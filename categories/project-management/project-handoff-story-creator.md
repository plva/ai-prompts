# Project Handoff Story Creator

**Category**: Project Management  
**Use Case**: Take over a project and create well-scoped stories from existing backlog  
**Tags**: handoff, stories, planning, architecture

## Prompt

You are now taking over **[Project Name]** design from a previous architect.

The project already has:

1. **A backlog of [X] stories** (see appendix) ordered by dependency.
2. **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) [range]** with rich context, decisions, and consequences.
3. A blog-style narrative that explains the guiding principles:
   - [Principle 1]
   - [Principle 2]
   - [Principle 3]
   - [Principle 4]

Your job is to continue carving work into well-scoped stories, each with clear phase splits (**Phase 1 = initial setup / scaffolding, Phase 2 = core implementation, Phase 3 = integration / deployment** or as appropriate for your project).

### What to produce in each answer

1. **Story header** – ## STORY — <Action>
2. **Goal** – plain-language purpose.
3. **Phases table** – what lands in each phase (Phase 1, Phase 2, etc.).
4. **Work items** – bullet list per phase.
5. **Acceptance checklist** – items grouped under each phase.
6. **Dependencies** – which ADRs/stories must be complete first.
7. Keep every story **self-contained**: a new contributor should understand context without reading the entire chat log.

### Stylistic conventions

* Use **Markdown**.
* Bullets over prose when describing checklists.
* Present code/config snippets in fenced blocks.
* Prefix code comments with brief explanations.
* For commit messages, follow **Conventional Commits** (type(scope): subject) and scopes we already use (docs, ci, build, etc.).
* If a change touches only documentation, the commit header must start with docs(…).

### What NOT to do

* Do **not** invent completely new tooling; prefer what exists in ADRs unless the story is explicitly about evaluating alternatives.
* Do **not** remove or rename existing recipes / labels / ADR IDs.
* Avoid speculating on implementation details outside the story's scope.

### When a new ADR is required

If your story introduces a *brand-new* strategic choice (e.g., adopting a different framework, changing architecture patterns), include:

### Requires ADR
*Title idea*: <short phrase>
*Rationale*: <1-2 sentences>

The next contributor will draft that ADR before code.

## STORY — Implement User Authentication System

### Goal
Add secure user authentication to enable user-specific features and data access.

| Phase | Purpose | Deliverables |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| Phase 1 | Setup authentication framework | Development environment |
| Phase 2 | Core authentication logic | User registration and login |
| Phase 3 | Integration and security hardening | Production-ready system |

#### Phase 1 Work items
- [ ] Choose authentication framework/library
- [ ] Set up development environment
- [ ] Create basic project structure
- [ ] Update documentation

#### Phase 1 Acceptance
- [ ] Framework selected and documented
- [ ] Development environment configured
- [ ] Project structure established
- [ ] Documentation updated

#### Phase 2 Work items
- [ ] Implement user registration
- [ ] Implement user login
- [ ] Add password validation
- [ ] Create user model

#### Phase 2 Acceptance
- [ ] Users can register successfully
- [ ] Users can login with valid credentials
- [ ] Password requirements enforced
- [ ] User data stored securely

#### Phase 3 Work items
- [ ] Integrate with existing application
- [ ] Add session management
- [ ] Implement security best practices
- [ ] Add error handling

#### Phase 3 Acceptance
- [ ] Authentication integrated with app
- [ ] Sessions work correctly
- [ ] Security vulnerabilities addressed
- [ ] Error scenarios handled

**Dependencies**: ADR 0015 Database Schema, Story "Setup Database Infrastructure".

### Appendix – Current Story List (IDs & titles only)
[List of existing stories and ADRs]

## Expected Output

A structured story with clear phases, work items, and acceptance criteria.

## Notes

Replace [Project Name], [X], [range], and [Principle X] with your specific project details. This prompt works well for any technical project with existing architecture documentation. Adjust the number and names of phases based on your project's needs.
