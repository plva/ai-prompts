## Prompt

Facilitate a structured brainstorming session for [topic/challenge/opportunity].

**Phase 1: Problem Definition**
- Clarify the core problem or opportunity
- Define success criteria and constraints
- Identify stakeholders and their needs
- Set the scope and boundaries

**Phase 2: Divergent Thinking**
Generate a wide range of ideas using these techniques:
- Free association and word mapping
- Analogies and metaphors from other domains
- Reverse thinking (what would make this worse?)
- Combination of existing concepts
- Future scenario thinking (5-10 years out)
- "What if?" questions with extreme scenarios

**Phase 3: Idea Development**
For the most promising ideas:
- Expand on implementation details
- Identify potential challenges and solutions
- Consider resource requirements
- Evaluate feasibility and impact
- Connect to business value or user needs

**Phase 4: Prioritization**
Rank ideas based on:
- Impact and value
- Feasibility and resources
- Innovation level
- Risk and uncertainty
- Alignment with goals

Provide at least 15 initial ideas, then develop the top 5 with detailed analysis.

## Expected Output

A structured brainstorming session with:
- Clear problem definition and scope
- Diverse initial ideas (15+)
- Detailed development of top 5 ideas
- Prioritization matrix with rationale
- Implementation considerations and next steps

## Notes

Replace [topic/challenge/opportunity] with your specific focus area. This structured approach helps move beyond surface-level ideas to actionable concepts. Adjust the number of ideas and phases based on your time constraints and needs.
